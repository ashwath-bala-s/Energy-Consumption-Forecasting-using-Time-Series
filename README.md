# Energy Consumption Forecasting using Time Series

**Introduction:**

Accurate forecasting of energy consumption is vital for optimizing energy production, ensuring efficient operation, and supporting strategic planning in the energy sector. By predicting future energy demands, utilities and energy providers can enhance resource allocation, reduce operational costs, and contribute to a more reliable and sustainable energy supply. This project aims to apply time series forecasting techniques to historical electricity consumption data to predict future energy needs and support better decision-making in energy management.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to develop a time series forecasting model that predicts future electricity consumption based on historical monthly data. By analyzing past consumption patterns, trends, and seasonal variations, the model will forecast the demand for upcoming months. The goal is to provide accurate and actionable forecasts that can assist in optimizing energy generation processes, improving resource planning, and supporting strategic decisions in energy management and market planning.

**Dataset:**

The Dataset used for this project has 969 records and has the following columns:

**(i) Dates:** Montly Dates from 01/1939 to 09/2019

**(ii) Energy Index:** Energy Consumption

**Project Description:**

• Performed detailed trend analysis to understand the time series data.

• Implemented data pre-processing steps to prepare the data for model building.

• Developed time series models including Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing (aka Holt Linear Trend Method), and Triple Exponential Smoothing (aka Holt Winter's Trend Method).

• Forecasted energy consumption for the next three years to optimize energy generation processes and enhance the comprehensive utilization of energy systems.

**Observation:**

Triple Exponential Model which has low RMSE value is performing better and has better forecasting capability in our project, is utilized for energy forecasting in our project.

**Skills:** Time Series Analysis · Data Pre-Processing · Simple Exponential Smoothing Model · Double Exponential Smoothing Model · Triple Exponential Smoothing Model
